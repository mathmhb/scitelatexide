This software can be considered as the replacement of TexPoint, but it can be used more widely, 
it can make you easily apply LaTeX/TeX, the powerful  typesetting tool (espectially the mathematical equations), to other documents.
TexPoint is good, but it can only used in Office2000 with PowerPoint, 
and VBA is required.
This software can work with any softwares supporting picture paste, of course, 
including Wordpad/Word/Excel/PowerPoint/WpsOffice/CCED2000/FrontPage/Maple/¡­¡­:)
LaTeX, dvips and GhostScript are required for this tool (these are all included in CTeX).
Do not need VBA, hence the popular Office97 mini version (with most functions but only about 20MB) and other word processing softwares can use LaTeX! :)
This tool supports both CJK and CCT, the two Chinese LaTeX, which is TexPoint can not do (this tool may support TianYuan in the future).
By the way, the file size of slides made by TexPoint may be big, but using this tool it may be small.
This software is portable, without installation, it has small size, and can be run directly.
In addition, this software works with freeware LaTeX macros, which makes it more easy to use!
When you use this software for the first time, please do not forget to do the necessarty settings first. 
If the commands latex, dvips, and gswin32c are not included in the search path, please click [Set paths].
If it still does not work, it is needed to click [Set commands] to set convertint a .tex file to a .ps file.
(do not forget to click [Apply] to enable the changed settings).
If there is no question after setting, please save the settings. 
You may say: I can not use it! It is very simple:-) 
Please copy (or type directly) your LaTeX source to the right textbox, 
then click [Compiled to BMP], the source will be compiled automatically, 
If there is no error, a figure will be created automatically (you can preview it below) and be copied to the clipboard, 
Now the only thing you need to do is to paste the figure from the clipboard  to the other softwares (you can press Ctrl+V)!
You feel troublesome? Please select a program in the top program list, then the figure will be sent to the corresponding program automatically!
I need the color! Check the [Color] box, then use your mouse to left-click or right-click [abc], do you see? Please try: 
\pagecolor{blue}\color{red}$\sqrt{2}=?$. Then what do you get?
You may ask: I want to include Chinese! Please click [Chi/Eng] to switch between Chinese and English support.
Maybe someone will ask: can I edit the BMP created before? The answer is no problem!
For example, there are many mathematical equations in your slides, they can also be created by this software. 
And then you need to modify the created equations, how to do? 
Click [Back] repeatedly or select the equation number from the dropdown list, now you can edit it! 
now you can edit and re-compile it! Of course, if you want to use these equations in the future, 
you can click [Save as] to save them in your computer.
Please discover the other functions by yourself! If you really do not know what the button\'s function is, you can hover your mouse on it, and then a hint will be displayed.

This software can help you to use power LaTeX math typesetting in any windows applications! Move mouse cursor to any button to see its function here:-)
Compile the latex code in the box into a bitmap, and the copy the bitmap to clipboard or send it to the application you have chosen.
Put the default latex template in the box.
Regard the latex code in the box as the default latex template.
Go back to the latex code in your comilation history.
Save the history of latex codes into a txl (TeX List) file for future reuse.
Reload a txl file so as you can reuse latex codes you ever used.
Display simple help hints for using this software.
Display simple license information for using this software.
Setup paths of some programs such as latex,dvips,gswin32c.
Setup batch commands for compiling latex codes.
Save your settings on latex template, program paths and batch commands into tex-bmp.ini so as I can load your settings automatically next time. 
Refress the list of current running applications for you to choose.
Open TMac for your convenience in inputting various latex symbols.
Open the latex code in the box with default editor.
Switch the latex template so as to support Chinese typesetting.
Check it so as to make this software always stay on top.
Check it so as to enter debug mode, showing more information during the compilation.
Check it so as to colorise the bitmap. Left/Right click the text [abc] to change background/foreground color.
Resolution determines the pixel resolution and scale of the generated bitmap.
Default generated bitmap is transparent black/white bitmap (bmpmono). Change it to other format so as support more latex colors (with larger bitmap data).
